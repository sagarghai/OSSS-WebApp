                                        Clinged to its branches & were nurtured
                                        By the soil in which penetrated its roots.
                                        From the skies that it touched

She has inspired a love of knowledge & truth in  Oxfordians and ignited their minds to reach the zeniths of success.

                                    <p>Education is integral for the growth and development of an individual. The expectation from an educational institution is always about making the society better for all and to bring one’s true potential in the service of mankind.

                                        The school fervently believes that education is the is the sole answer to the quest of the children to achieve excellence through the nurturing of their abilities to predict, infer, analyses and them in the end arrive at the entrepreneurial answers. It is the constant endeavor of the school to initiate the process of continued learning. Education is a lifelong never ending process where there is no consumption but only investment of mind and intellect.

                                        A mighty river and Oxford share a common chord-starting with a humble beginning and going through meandering course till they reach their destination.

                                        Forty years ago Oxford laid its humble foundation, struggled hard and has carved a niche for itself earning the rightfully deserved recognition. The conducive environment, matching infrastructure and competent faculty of the school harmonizes into a perfect blend of excellence in contemporary education. With the untiring attempts of our staff, constant support of parents and zealous performance of our students the institution is sure to stay steadfastly at the pinnacle of success.

                                        Come watch our Oxford Falcons soar to success. We believe, “Today we write and read, tomorrow we succeed”.</p>

                                        Oxford is rapidly moving towards excellence and wining laurels and accolades in numerous competitions.

                                        In this world of information explosion it is necessary that students are well equipped to handle information available to them. The school possesses that distinctive character which not only assists students to sift through the information, but also develops in them the salability to choose only what is relevant and required. The institution aims at developing not only the intellect of the child, but also his emotional and spiritual quotient and all these three put together help the students to reach the pinnacle of excellence.

                                        The newsletter is an attempts to focus on the accolades and achievements of the Oxfordians during the year. Encapsulating all this also gives an idea of the direction in which the school is moving. I would like to congratulation the students whose names and achievement appears in this issues.Others, however , should try to emulate their example.

                                        <p>The goal of true education should be to manifest the potential divinity in man, and not the amount of information that is put into the drain and runs riot there. Highest of structures rest on the strongest of foundations. Thus a strong base is a must for a successful career and life. Excellence in academics has been a regular feature at Oxford, where the students are encouraged to develop clarity of thought, logical reasoning, ability to analyse and interpret, thereby preparing them to face the challenges of life outside the protected environment of the school.

                                            In the Pre-school and Pre-primary, teaching-learning is based entirely on playway methods. At Primary level, catering to the growing needs of the pupils, group activities as well as individual work habits are developed. Class VI onwards lecture method, student participation, projects, and practical work form the essential part of teaching-learning process.

                                            The whole academic year is divided into two terms called First term from April to September and the Second Term from September to March.

                                            A pupil who fails to attain the required standard in all the subjects will not be promoted. Reports of general progress will be given in the progress card. This should be carefully studied and returned to the school authorities signed by the parents or guardians.

                                            Classes Pre-School to V will be awarded grades only. Any student getting E Grade at the end of III term will be advised to repeat the class.
