                                        Education is integral for the growth and development of an individual. The expectation from an educational institution is always about making the society better for all and to bring one’s true potential in the service of mankind.

                                        The school fervently believes that education is the is the sole answer to the quest of the children to achieve excellence through the nurturing of their abilities to predict, infer, analyses and them in the end arrive at the entrepreneurial answers. It is the constant endeavor of the school to initiate the process of continued learning. Education is a lifelong never ending process where there is no consumption but only investment of mind and intellect.

                                        A mighty river and Oxford share a common chord-starting with a humble beginning and going through meandering course till they reach their destination.

                                        Forty years ago Oxford laid its humble foundation, struggled hard and has carved a niche for itself earning the rightfully deserved recognition. The conducive environment, matching infrastructure and competent faculty of the school harmonizes into a perfect blend of excellence in contemporary education. With the untiring attempts of our staff, constant support of parents and zealous performance of our students the institution is sure to stay steadfastly at the pinnacle of success.

                                        Come watch our Oxford Falcons soar to success. We believe, “Today we write and read, tomorrow we succeed”.

                                        It gives me immense pleasure that oxford is coming out with the next issues of the newsletter which is the culmination of a year’s activities that go on in the school.  It is looked forward to by the students as well as parents.

                                        Oxford is rapidly moving towards excellence and wining laurels and accolades in numerous competitions.

                                        In this world of information explosion it is necessary that students are well equipped to handle information available to them. The school possesses that distinctive character which not only assists students to sift through the information, but also develops in them the salability to choose only what is relevant and required. The institution aims at developing not only the intellect of the child, but also his emotional and spiritual quotient and all these three put together help the students to reach the pinnacle of excellence.

                                        The newsletter is an attempts to focus on the accolades and achievements of the Oxfordians during the year. Encapsulating all this also gives an idea of the direction in which the school is moving. I would like to congratulation the students whose names and achievement appears in this issues.Others, however , should try to emulate their example.
